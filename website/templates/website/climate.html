            <p>The world has been facing a climate crisis for a long time now. It is perhaps one of the most important issues that we are encountering at the moment and it is getting worse as the years progress. The earth did have a break at the beginning of the COVID-19 Lockdown. We all saw how nature thrived when people across the globe were under quarantine but as the year went on, the climate is back to where it was before the pandemic. In fact, it is worse than ever before. The pandemic also had a negative impact on different aspects - social, economic, and political - of people's lives; women in particular and those coming from marginalized communities proved to be the most vulnerable groups.</p>
            <p>
              However, with everything else that we manage to overcome, women are stepping up and leading the fight against global warming. It is safe to say that women can be found among the decision-makers of climate action. These women are at the forefront of the battle and have set an inspiring example for the rest of the citizens of the globe. 
            </p>
            <p>Let us take a look at who some of these women are and what have been their initiatives.</p>

              New Zealand became known for its effective response and strategies to control the spread of COVID-19. Adding another golden feather was Jacinda Ardern's (the PM of the country) climate change motion as soon as she won the elections in October 2020. The motion acknowledged the Paris Agreement, an agreement with the UNFCC on climate change, and the Zero Carbon Act passed in New Zealand in 2019, and Jacinda Ardern pledged to turn New Zealand into a carbon-neutral country by 2025.
