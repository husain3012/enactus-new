        /> Project 'Irtiqa' (Urdu for evolution) is a socio-entrepreneurial
        project of Enactus Jamia Millia Islamia based in the vicinity of Jamia
        Nagar, Okhla. The project supports the objectives put down by the
        National Bamboo Mission of India and the United Nations' goals for
        sustainable development. With a demand of an estimated 26 million metric
        tons, the industry is expected to significantly grow further in the near
        future, transforming it into a buzzing ground for small entrepreneurs.
        Being the second largest producer of bamboo all over the world, the
        bamboo industry in India is a booming hot-spot creating an approximate
        profit of Rs.9,000 crores for the country.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">MISSION</p>
      <p text-align="justify">
        “The bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists”. The
        project aims to create an alternative to the depleting source of
        business for the local community of the woodworkers by introducing them
        to the art of bamboo handicrafts. Bamboo is an easily available raw
        material which is eco-friendly and helps us to hold up our core value
        that is sustainable development.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">OVERVIEW</p>
      <p text-align="justify">
        <li>
          Indian artisans are globally recognized for their handicrafts.
          However, due to industrialization and cheap production of plastic, the
          artisans continue to face substantial losses over the years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Residing in the suburbs of South East Delhi, the community of Khadda
          wood workers has experienced a loss of 50-55% of their profits to the
          middlemen and exhaustion of interests in showcases. Such losses
          necessitated the requirement for an alternate method of livelihood for
          them. The raw material they used was also quite expensive which
          further added to their problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is where we took the opportunity to help the Khadda wood-workers
          community and made them switch to the bamboo craft business. This
          helped in cutting them off from the exploitation and the under-paid
          slavery that they were being subjected to by the dire working
          conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bamboo can be grown in almost any climatic condition and is already
          largely grown in the Jamia Nagar area making it even more suitable for
          a smooth supply chain, added to that this low cost raw material leads
          to an increase in the actual profit.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: left">GOALS</p>
      <li>
        Revival of the depleting business opportunities for the community of
        Khadda woodworkers by introducing them to bamboo handicrafts.
      </li>
      <li class="justify">
        Cutting off the production cost by eliminating the interference of
        middlemen and thus, increasing the final profit by exposing the
        community to larger markets.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        Training the workers in the craft of making bamboo-products while also
        ensuring that safety measures are taken care of with provision of
        gloves, aprons and safety masks.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        Promotion of digital literacy and imparting life-skills of digital
        marketing on e-commerce websites, digital payment, enabling them with
        skills to manage inventory, handling logistics like delivery and
        packaging on their own.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        Bamboo absorbs greenhouse gases 5 times more efficiently than wood and
        thus proves to be a ‘Climate-smart Solution’ hence promoting
        sensitization regarding the alarming environmental concerns.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        Bamboo emits 30% more oxygen and absorbs substantial amounts of carbon
        emission hence making our project at par with the 2018 Paris Summit’s
        objective to limit the global warming level at 1.5°C.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        Ensuring zero-waste in production by using the remains of the bamboo to
        manufacture edible products such as pickles.
      </li>
      <br />
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: left">
        EMPOWERMENT
      </p>
      <li>
        We provided the wood workers with better entrepreneurial skills to make
        them capable of financial autonomy and a sustainable business model to
        guide them in that direction.
      </li>

      <li>
        They were also exposed to a larger digital market, making them at par
        with the modern day technological advancements while also exposing them
        to new areas of marketing and business.
      </li>
      <br />

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: left">IMPACT</p>
      <li>
        Raw material for our community is now available at a cheaper price
        increasing their income exponentially.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have actively spread awareness regarding ‘Green Building’ which
        utilizes bamboo as an alternative to hardwood.
      </li>

      <li>
        The bamboo products manufactured were sold in local markets like INA
        Haat and e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Enactus JMI Store.
      </li>

      <br />
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: left">
        WAY FORWARD
      </p>
      <li>
        As we continue to strengthen our brand name and expand our project, we
        plan to move one step further through the production of bamboo charcoal,
        which is widely used for water purification and has other health
        benefits. We also plan to take the project to greater heights by
        introducing our own collection of space-saving furniture. Due to
        COVID-19 raging over the world, we have also planned to switch towards
        online marketplace as a precautionary measure against the pandemic.
      </li>
      <br />

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: left">NEEDS</p>
      <p>
        We seek to fulfil the three aspects of need: The social and the economic
        needs of the community and the environmental needs of our planet.
